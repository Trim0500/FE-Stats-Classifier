# FE Stats Classifier
---
### Stats to Analyze
- HP
- Atk (If !Echoes or Binding Blade, average the Str w/Mag)
- Skl/Dex
- Spd
- Lck
- Def
- Res
---
---
### Metrics
- Mean = sum of stat / count of stat
- Standard Deviation = sqrt(sum of diff of mean squared / count of stat)
- Normalization = diff of mean / std
---
---
### Key Points
- Analysis based on comparison with character with most amount of appearances (provided stats are comparable) and stat disribution (in %) after normalizing data and averaging
- Use base stats from joining time
- Include DLC and other means outside of strict base game availability
- No spin-offs (except FEH)
- Do not include seasonal FEH alts
